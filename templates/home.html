    <h2>
      How it all started 
    </h2>
    <p class="bodytext">
      My coding journey began with a desire to create Android applications, and I found a great starting point with FlutterFlow, a no-code platform that let me bring my ideas to life without needing to write code. From there, my curiosity grew, and I started learning Python to create simple games, like a Flappy Bird clone, and even a music player app. I’ve also dabbled in website development, constantly exploring new ways to build and enhance my skills. Each project has brought me closer to mastering the art of coding, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.

    <h3>
      My struggles
    </h3>
    <p class="bodytext">
      Like any journey, mine has had its fair share of challenges. When I first started working with FlutterFlow, I faced obstacles in understanding how to add complex functionalities without coding. As I moved on to Python, there were moments when simple bugs or installation issues with packages, like pip, felt overwhelming. Creating games and apps often came with unexpected roadblocks, whether it was integrating features or fixing logic errors. My work on a Discord bot also hit snags, especially when dealing with speech recognition and AI models. Despite the frustrations, each struggle has taught me valuable lessons, making me more resilient and pushing me to find creative solutions.

    <h5>
      My Journey 
    </h5>
    <p class="bodytext">
      My journey into coding has been an exciting and transformative experience. What started as a simple interest in creating Android apps without writing code quickly evolved into a passion for problem-solving and development. As I ventured into Python, I built games, developed a music player app, and even experimented with AI by creating a Discord bot. Along the way, I explored website creation, adding another skill to my toolkit. With each project, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of coding, design, and how technology can bring ideas to life. While I still have much to learn, I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited for the future ahead.
